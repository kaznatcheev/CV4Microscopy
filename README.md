# CV4Microscopy
Some simple computer vision code for analyzing data from automated time-lapse microscopy

This code was used as part of the [game assay pipeline](https://github.com/kaznatcheev/GameAssay). _Data Availability_: If you're interested in the raw images used there then due to the large file sizes please reach out by email so we can coordinate.

Early versions of some of this code appeared in the [MathOnco](https://github.com/kaznatcheev/MathOnco) repository.
